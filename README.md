## Gameplay
The goal is to prevent the enemies (Robots) from reaching the Crystal by placing defence towers along the path that leads to the treasure.
As the project is in its beginning stages, the robots follow only one path, and their objective is to destroy the crystal with 2000 points of health. Every second that passes, the robots inflict 5 points of damage when they are close to the crystal.
         
To defend the chests, the player can only place __three__ defense towers along the path that will shoot and eliminate Robots. As mentioned before, since the project is in its beginning stages, there is only one tower available for selection that can be created every __eight__ seconds and above.
